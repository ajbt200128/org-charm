* Abstract

This paper explores the evolution of computing from mechanical
calculators to modern quantum computers[fn:1].

* Early Mechanical Computers

The history of computing begins with mechanical devices like
the abacus[fn:abacus] and Babbage's Analytical Engine[fn:babbage].

* The Digital Revolution

The transition to electronic computing[fn:transition] marked a
fundamental shift in capabilities and applications.

* Conclusion

Computing continues to evolve at an unprecedented pace[fn:moore].

[fn:1] For a comprehensive overview, see "Computing: A Concise
History" by Paul Ceruzzi[fn:ceruzzi].

[fn:ceruzzi] MIT Press, 2012. Ceruzzi also wrote about space
technology[fn:space].

[fn:space] "Beyond the Limits: Flight Enters the Computer Age" (1989).

[fn:abacus] Dating back to 2400 BCE in Babylon[fn:babylon].

[fn:babylon] The Babylonians also developed early mathematical
notation systems.

[fn:babbage] Charles Babbage (1791-1871) designed but never
completed the Analytical Engine[fn:ada].

[fn:ada] Ada Lovelace wrote the first algorithm intended for
the machine, making her the first computer programmer.

[fn:transition] ENIAC (1945) is often cited as the first
general-purpose electronic computer[fn:eniac-debate].

[fn:eniac-debate] Though this claim is contested by proponents
of other machines like the Colossus[fn:colossus].

[fn:colossus] The Colossus machines were used for British
codebreaking during WWII but remained classified for decades.

[fn:moore] Moore's Law has held for over 50 years[fn:limits-moore],
though physical limits are now being reached.

[fn:limits-moore] Current transistors are approaching atomic
scale, requiring new paradigms like quantum computing[fn:quantum].

[fn:quantum] Quantum computing uses qubits which can exist in
superposition, potentially solving certain problems exponentially
faster.

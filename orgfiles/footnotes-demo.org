* Introduction to Footnotes

This document demonstrates the nested footnotes feature in org-charm.
Footnotes are a great way to add supplementary information without
cluttering the main text[fn:1].

* Basic Footnotes

Org-mode supports inline footnotes and named footnotes. Here's an
example of a basic footnote[fn:2]. You can also use numbered
footnotes[fn:3] for simpler references.

* Nested Footnotes in Action

This is where it gets interesting! When you have complex topics,
sometimes a footnote needs its own footnote[fn:complex]. This creates
a hierarchy of supplementary information.

Consider academic writing where you might cite a source[fn:academic],
and that source itself has important caveats that deserve their own
annotation.

* Technical Documentation

In technical docs, you might explain a concept[fn:tech] that requires
diving deeper into implementation details, which themselves have
edge cases worth noting.

* Conclusion

Nested footnotes help organize complex information hierarchically,
making documents more readable while preserving depth for those
who want it[fn:meta].

* Footnotes

[fn:1] Footnotes appear at the bottom of the document and provide
additional context without interrupting the flow of reading.

[fn:2] This is a simple footnote. Nothing fancy here - just
additional information about the topic at hand.

[fn:3] Numbered footnotes are concise and easy to reference.

[fn:complex] This footnote explains a complex topic. But wait -
there's more detail needed here[fn:nested1], and even another
point worth mentioning[fn:nested2].

[fn:nested1] This is a *nested* footnote (level 1). It provides
deeper context for the parent footnote. Sometimes you need to go
even deeper[fn:deep1].

[fn:nested2] Another nested footnote at level 1. This one covers
a different aspect of the complex topic mentioned above.

[fn:deep1] Now we're at level 2! This is displayed with roman
numerals (i, ii, iii). You could theoretically go even deeper[fn:deeper].

[fn:deeper] Level 3 uses Greek letters. This is probably as deep
as you'd ever want to go in practice.

[fn:academic] Academic citation example. This source has important
methodology notes[fn:method] and limitations[fn:limits].

[fn:method] The methodology used in this study involved multiple
phases, each with their own considerations[fn:phase1].

[fn:phase1] Phase 1 involved initial data collection with specific
protocols that differed from later phases.

[fn:limits] Important limitations include sample size and temporal
constraints.

[fn:tech] Technical concept: API rate limiting. The implementation
details[fn:impl] vary by use case.

[fn:impl] Implementation uses token bucket algorithm with configurable
parameters. Edge cases[fn:edge] should be handled gracefully.

[fn:edge] Edge cases include burst traffic patterns and clock skew
in distributed systems.

[fn:meta] This footnote is self-referential - it's about footnotes!
The feature you're using right now[fn:recursive] demonstrates the
full depth of nested annotation support.

[fn:recursive] And this footnote references the footnote system
itself. We could keep going[fn:turtles], but let's stop here.

[fn:turtles] It's turtles all the way down! But seriously, four
levels (numbers, letters, roman numerals, Greek) should cover
any practical use case.
